0000: Rotating device resets activity

0001 [RESOLVED]: Config fields don't update upon pressing play, only when TextEdits lose focus

0002 [RESOLVED]: Pressing Play in Config activity while an EditText has focus loads Game activity with transparent navigation bar

0003 [RESOLVED]: Removing stylus shows opaque navigation bar that can only be hidden by loading new activity

0004: Going from one EditText to another directly (focus on one, click on the other) disables ability to enter text on Pixel XL

0005: Clicking OK on high score dialog sometimes shows nav bar
